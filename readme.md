####:flower_playing_cards: How to Play
1.  Click on the **card** that you think will be higher (the face up card or the face down card).
    -   A border will appear around the card selected and the face down card will be revealed.
    -   A mesage will be displayed as to whether or guess was correct or incorrect.
    -   The win loss stats will be updated for both current and todate.  Todate stats are saved to local storage after each guess.
2.  Click on the **Draw Next Card** button
    -   The card that was face down is moved to the face up position.
    -   Another card is drawn and placed face down.  Note:  cards are reshuffled when there are 10 cards left in the deck so you never run out of playing cards.
